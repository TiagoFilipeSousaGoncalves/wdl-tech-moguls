    "## What is the problem?\n",
    "As stated by the challenge provider in the official document, \"*cities are flooded by countless outdoor advertising panels, often with a poor distribution*\". Hence, we acknowledge that these visual aspects are crucial in the urban planning process since each plan choice can generate obstruction of urban elements, thus producing adverse effects on the city’s image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we relate this problem with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?\n",
    "Once again, we started by looking at the official document given by the challenge provider, which establishes a connection between this challenge and the **11th UN Sustainable Goal - Sustainable Cities and Communities**. From an attentive look at the scope of this 11th SDG, we can conclude that this is, somehow, related to the topic of \"*Sustainable cities and human settlements*\" (please refer to [https://sdgs.un.org/topics/sustainable-cities-and-human-settlements](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/sustainable-cities-and-human-settlements)). Since it is expected that the number of people in cities will grow significantly by 2050, it is of utmost importance that policy- and decision-makers define a sustainable strategy to assure that their cities have the right infrastructures to keep up with this development rate. We highlight two important ideas:\n",
    " - *Improving human settlements management*; \n",
    " - *Promoting sustainable land-use planning and management*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas above are directly related to the proper organisation of outdoor advertising panels in cities in the sense that careful management may contribute to an increase of visual quality of streets and roads but also allows to increase the focus on the message and the announcement that the panel intends to transmit. Therefore, we agree that reducing the outdoor advertising visual impact in cities will contribute to minimising the reduction of the audience of the outdoor ad sector, thus improving the visual environment of cities and the sustainability of outdoor advertising activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we propose to solve this problem?\n",
    "We developed a metaheuristics-based algorithm (local/neighbourhood search) that optimises the outdoor-billboard density (*i.e.*, the number of outdoor billboards in a given radius). We start by creating neighbour solutions through swap operations in which we change the coordinates of a given billboard and assess the impact on hour fitness function, which takes this variable into account. In the end, we are capable of proposing an alternative layout for the billboard location without needing to remove billboards. Why did we not want to remove billboards? Well, we do not know if by removing a billboard we are jeopardising the business of a given company. Therefore, we tried to keep our problem approach as simples as possible and thinking about the stakeholders as well."
